# Here I document "established" computational procedures, i.e., procedures that successfully generated output relevant to the project. Results from these procedures should be readily reproducible although not all of them will contribute to the final manuscript.

# The procedures are established from my Journal at Work, a collection of dairy style documents updated everday to keep a record of plans, todo's, done's along with computer commands implementing the day's work. These "raw" records are only accessible by myself.

# The procedures are organized in separate "chapters" each for a specific assignment. They will be compiled to formats including @@markdown@@, @@pdf@@ and @@dokuwiki@@.
