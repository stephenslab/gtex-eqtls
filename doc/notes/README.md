## Document of established computational procedures

Here I document "established" computational procedures, i.e., procedures
that successfully generated output relevant to the project. Results from these 
procedures should be readily reproducible although not all of them will contribute 
to the final manuscript. 

The procedures are established from my Journal at Work, a collection of 
dairy style documents updated everday to keep a record of plans, todo's, done's along 
with computer commands implementing the day's work. These "raw" records are only
accessible by myself.

The procedures are organized in separate "chapters" each for a specific
assignment. They will be compiled to a single PDF document via `make pdf` or
a single password protected webpage on my website via `make dokuwiki` 
(default) which is easier to browse. Notes on special topics can be generated
separatedly for sharing with others. Currently the build list of special topics
is:

```
make sumstats # User documentation for summary statistics database in HDF5 format
