    "## 20180108 GTEx V8 data status update\n",
    "\n",
    "AWG call.\n",
    "\n",
    "V8 release timeline: End of December 2017 internal release. End of June 2018 public release (dbGAP embargo period).\n",
    "\n",
    "Francois, recap of status:\n",
    "\n",
    "- End of December 2017: data was largely complete. 838 donors, ~16,000 RNA seq samples\n",
    "- Major change is phased + imputed genotype, analysis are updated\n",
    "  - with exception of: allelic fold change calculation and sQTL results (`leafcutter`) but both will be available next week\n",
    "  - eQTL results has been updated with imputed genotypes\n",
    "- Annotation files etc are uploaded for fine-mapping\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuuli: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The need to compile \"official\" GTEx regulatory annotations from ensembl + encode roadmap\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuuli, V8 paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Strict reproducibility is perhaps not realistic given the time frame, but we should put all scripts and documentation of analysis in github, for transparency.\n",
    "  - Just a github directory for GTEx V8 main paper, and consolidate people's work\n",
    "  - Will be made public when the paper comes out\n",
    "  - Problems:\n",
    "    - Manolis: How do you link existing repo to main paper repo? Redudant work for people who already has organized separate github repos.\n",
    "    - Francois: How about scripts private to a cluster environment? \n",
    "      - Tuuli: compensate with good documentation; does not have to be runnable.\n",
    "    - Manolis: Dumping everything in github but not runnable will likely lead to lots of critism and complaints. Maybe share core scripts is enough.\n",
    "      - Francois and Tuuli disagree that people will attack such practice.\n",
    "      - Manolis insists that people expect Consortium work come with quality and completness not sloppiness ... thus deeply worried. Maybe into each individual analysts github repos would be better, not under GTEx umbrella and not intended to be user-friendly. But make the \"key\" methodology scripts very well documented and runnable, not those one-liners, hacks and data processing.\n",
    "- Companion papers: Google doc will be sent out to the group.\n",
    "  - Any papers should be discussed with AWG; no unpleasant surprises.\n",
    "  - Submission embargo? biorxiv embargo? End of 2018 or submission of main paper whichever first.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Kristin:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Push out main paper; review presentation list"

    "## 20171211 GTEx fine mapping workgroup meeting\n",
    "Phone conference with GTEx members from many cities ... Andrew presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software to apply:\n",
    "- Farhad Caviar: PIP on all tissues, 3 days\n",
    "- Andrew Caveman: PIP on all tissues, but whole blood first, a couple of days; all tissues 3 weeks\n",
    "- William DAP-G: a couple of days per tissue. A couple of tissues to start from.\n",
    "  - PIP\n",
    "  - LD clusters\n",
    "- Possibly 1 or 2 more software\n",
    "- Results for all tissues will be available mid-Jan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data:\n",
    "- Francois: VCF are almost final, though missingness are causing confusion (but in short we can mean-impute them). Should be finalized mid-week this week\n",
    "- Andrew: ChIP-seq benchmarks (an annotation list) to be shared. The data comes from roadmap epigenomics and will be lifted over to V9 data.\n",
    "- Tuuli: Has annotation for post transcriptional modification\n",
    "- William: Has annotation for TFBS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation data: \n",
    "- Andrew: not necessary. or at least should not be too close to the way any methods work. eg, no one-eqtl per gene type of setup.\n",
    "- William: is necessary. no need to worry about generating from certain models. Simulation based on simple linear model is generic enough.\n",
    "- Eleazar: Simulation results not interesting, compared to ChIP-seq / other annotation benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploration then benchmarking, or benchmarking right now?\n",
    "- Blood results before Christmas, so that benchmarking can be put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Benchmarking:\n",
    "- Input: data and annotation. Annotation can be used for tests, or for validation\n",
    "  - Caveman now taks pre-computed annotations\n",
    "  - Some type of Enrichment summary\n",
    "- Output: scores?\n",
    "  - Gao has to figure out these\n",
    "  - PIP, lfdr? at variant vs. gene level? how about LD cluster based methods?\n",
    "- Blood results ready in a week to start putting together benchmarks. \n",
    "- All tissues by mid-Jan\n",
    "  - data availability\n",
    "\n",
    "Extension of methods:\n",
    "- cell-specific eQTLs\n",
    "- splicing eQTLs\n",
    "- age dependent QTLs\n",
    "- co-localisation\n",
    "  - Haky: GWAS group is also interested\n",
    "- multiple traits\n",
    "  - Tuuli: can anyone put together a quick&dirty M&M analysis? \n",
    "    - Tuuli's group is developing something\n",
    "  - Andrew: pairwise tissue analysis\n",
    "  - William: can look at a few tissues\n",

    "* probability estimates of each variant being causal\n",
    "    * how to verify it? experimentally?\n",
    "* Should use 1MB region?\n",
    "    * 100KB should not lose a lot.\n",

    "    * on Thyroid data\n",
    "    * channel in Slack for this topic\n",
    "\n",
    "General flavors\n",
    "* Enrichment of eQTLs giving annotations: \n",
    "    * @william: Same model but various ways to estimate priors. Open to different prior options. Also see concensus results from different methods is also important.\n",
    "    * But measuring consensus is difficult. Correlation is high but individual level there are problems.\n",
    "* Conditional analysis: soon to be uploaded to `exchange`\n",
    "* Additional type of integrated analysis\n",
    "    * @eric\n",

    "### Interest in fine-mapping companion paper?\n",
    "People are interested. There is also co-localization working group, but not progressing much.\n",

    "It is important but computationally hard. William is the only one who positively responed, but he only agree to do a few tissues.\n",
